# Personal Task Tracker – Project Specification

## Project Overview

As your client, I want a web-based Personal Task Tracker that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application should be user-friendly, secure, and accessible across devices. It should support multiple users, enabling each user to manage their own list of tasks.

## User Stories

### Core User Stories

1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - As a new user, I want to sign up with an email and password so that I can have a private account.
   - As a returning user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my tasks.
   - As a user, I want to log out to secure my information.

2. **Task Management (CRUD)**
   - As a user, I want to add new tasks with a title and optional description so that I can remember what I need to do.
   - As a user, I want to view a list of all my tasks so that I can keep track of them.
   - As a user, I want to edit any of my tasks in case my plans change.
   - As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer needed.

3. **Task Completion**
   - As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete so I can track my progress.
   - As a user, I want completed tasks to be visually distinguished from incomplete ones.

4. **Task Organization**
   - As a user, I want to set due dates for tasks so I can prioritize them.
   - As a user, I want to filter or sort tasks by completion status, due date, or creation date.

### Extended User Stories

5. **Task Categories or Tags**
   - As a user, I want to assign categories or tags to my tasks so I can organize them better.

6. **Reminders/Notifications (Optional)**
   - As a user, I want to receive email or in-app reminders for tasks with due dates.

7. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - As a user, I want the app to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
